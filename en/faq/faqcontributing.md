## I am not a programmer

### I would like to improve the help page. What are the steps?

### I would like to help translating JabRef to another language. How do I get started?

We encourage you to read about [translating the JabRef user interface](./how-to-translate-the-ui.md).

### I want to keep Wikipedia pages up-to-date

JabRef improves -- and Wikipedia pages should keep up!

Simply click on "Edit" \(top right-hand tab\).

Currently existing pages are:
