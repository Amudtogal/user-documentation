# Cleanup entries

JabRef can cleanup the entries of a database. To do a cleanup of the entries, go to **Quality â†’ Cleanup entries**. Then select the actions to be carried out.

![The Cleanup entries dialog](../.gitbook/assets/cleanupdialog.png)

In the lower part, you can choose `Enable field formatter`. Then you can select different [formating actions](../advanced/saveactions.md) using the drop-down menus. A click on the "circular arrow" icon enables a set of recommanded formatting actions \(the set of actions will depend on your database type: BibTeX or biblatex\).
