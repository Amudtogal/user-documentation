# Fetching entries from CiteSeerX

[CiteSeerX](http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/about) is a public search engine for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science. However, CiteSeerX has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics, physics and others \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteSeer)\).

To fetch entries from CiteSeerX, choose **Search â†’ Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **CiteSeerX** in the dropdown menu. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press Enter or the **Fetch** button.

The results are displayed in the [import inspection window](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/tree/1f58696d9081b60bf60823090c7594d67d7f5295/en/ImportInspectionDialog/README.md). In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
