# Fetching entries from zbMATH

[zbMATH](https://www.zbmath.org/) is a reviewing service providing reviews and abstracts for articles in pure and applied mathematics \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zentralblatt_MATH)\).

To fetch entries from zbMATH, choose **Search â†’ Web search**, and the search interface will appear in the side pane. Select **zbMATH** in the dropdown menu. To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press Enter or the **Fetch** button.

Then, the results are displayed in the [import inspection window](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/tree/1f58696d9081b60bf60823090c7594d67d7f5295/en/ImportInspectionDialog/README.md). In case an error occurs, it is shown in a popup.
